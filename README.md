This paper is firstly been rejected by AAAI 2023 with a mixture score (6,6,4,4) and then been accepted by the ICME 2023.

The final codes is missed due to the long time. We can just find the initial version training codes, which is similar with the final one, the difference only lies in semi-supervised and supervised in the loss calculation, and the alignment step. There are sufficient annotations to understand the idea of the main code.

The relabeled dataset TextCaps-OCR v2 is based on the TextCaps-OCR v1, which is published on the PRCV 2022.

You can download the TextCaps-OCR v2 on the Baidu Cloud Disk:
